## Creating a sample script

library(here)
- creates an unbreakable file path
- makes collaboration easier
- use the function here::here()
- ex. my_data<-read_csv(here("data_folder","sb_temp.csv"))
  - searches for the csv within data_folder
- put a comma through every directory level
  - for more embedded files, you would have multiple commas
- note to self: change all my filepaths in SilbigerLab lol
