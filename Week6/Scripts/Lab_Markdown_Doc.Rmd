# Introduction 
Today we are gong to work with the penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*.

## Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
```

```{r,include = FALSE}
here() # set working directory
```


# Inspect the data
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# include = FALSE means this code and output won't show in the HTML doc
# echo = FALSE means the Output will show but not the code
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
This is a plot of penguin bill length by bill depth.  **Species** are in colors.  
Species:
- Gentoo  
  - first penguin  
- Adelie  
  - second penguin  
- Chinstrap  
  - third penguin  

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+ # here is the linear model
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", 
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")+
  theme_bw()
```
