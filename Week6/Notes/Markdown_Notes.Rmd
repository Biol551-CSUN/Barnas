# Markdown Class Notes
## Week 6
## March 1, 2021

Note: Doc will not knit with current format. for Notes only

Markdown doc: What's inside
- Metadata
- Text
- Code
- Output
  
YAML: Yet Another Markdown Language
- always goes at the top of the markdown doc
- describes the type of document
- need at least two pieces (but there are many more you could use): 
  - title
  - output
- there are multiple themes you can use
- you can add a table of contents
- the tabbed location of keys matters. make sure subsets are indented below the heading element
  
Text elements:  
- Headers
  - used to determine what's in the Table of Contents
  - largest, most encapsulating header has one #
  - second, slightly smaller header uses two ## 
  - etc.
- Bold
  - use **two asterisks** to bold something
- Italics
  - use *one asterisk* to italicize something
- Add a new line
  - you need to add a double space at the end of a line of text.
- Lists
  1. can just
  1. use the
  1. number 1
  1. and still get enumeration
- Images: put an ! before[Name of Image](http or filepath of image)
- Links: same as above but no !

Code Chunks
- insert code using:
- Cmnd + Options + i
```{r}
# Now we are interacting with R in the same way we normally would

# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# will not show warnings or R messages when script runs. only show the clean output

# include = FALSE prevents code and results from showing up 
# eval = FALSE excludes the code chunk
# echo = FALSE prevents code but not results from appearing in the finished file
# message = FALSE prevents messages from showing
# fig.cap = "..." adds a figure caption
# there are others as well
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, # ALWAYS show the code
                      warning = FALSE) # NEVER show the warnings
```
  
```{r}
# Today's Totally awesome R package
library(beepr)
#beep(5)
#beep(8)
```
